### Useful resources

- [How to have multiple CSS transitions on an element](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7048313/how-to-have-multiple-css-transitions-on-an-element) - This helped me add transition effects for both transform and opacity of a button. It cannot be any simpler, but very useful.
- [A comprehensive guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me whenever I need to 'peek' a little into flexbox's commands. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Can you change CSS Grid row/column gap on specific elements?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50531432/css-grid-row-column-gap-on-specific-elements) - Today I learned that this is not possible.
